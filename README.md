# Combined-NAIS-DMPS-APS-instrument-data-analysis-and-plots-Hyytiälä-2010-2023
This repository provides a workflow for analyzing and visualizing long-term data from NAIS (~1–40 nm), DMPS (~3–800 nm), and APS (~0.5–20 µm) at Hyytiälä (2010–2023), enabling full-spectrum study of ion and particle size distributions from nanometer clusters to micrometer particles.
